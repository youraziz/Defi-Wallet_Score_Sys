# DeFi Wallet Credit Scoring

This repository contains code and resources for a blockchain-based credit scoring system that analyzes transaction data from decentralized finance (DeFi) wallets. The project aims to provide machine learning models and analytics that assess the creditworthiness of DeFi users based on their wallet histories.

**Folder comments:**  
- `data/` — For any datasets (CSV, JSON, etc.) you use or generate.  
- `models/` — Save your trained model files (e.g., .pkl, .pt, .h5).  
- `notebooks/` — Use for experimentation and development of models or data exploration (Jupyter notebooks).  
- `src/` — Store all custom code (Python scripts, function definitions, utility modules).  
- `visualizations/` — Save any analytic plots or charts you create with your code.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
git clone https://github.com/youraziz/defi-wallet-credit-scoring.git
cd defi-wallet-credit-scoring

2. **Set up your environment:**
- **(Optional but recommended)** Create a virtual environment:
  ```
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- **Install project dependencies:**
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

3. **Add Data:**
- Place any input datasets in the `data/` directory.

## Usage

- Develop and test your analysis and models in `notebooks/`.
- Implement all reusable code components, scripts, and functions in `src/`.
- Save your trained models to `models/`.
- Place output figures and plots in `visualizations/` for reporting or presentation purposes.
